CS50 finance is a website via which users can "buy" and "sell" stocks.

This task was also challenging for me because I had to implement a lot of different things with SQLite, Jinja, APIs and Python of course.

I had some distribution code, templates and some CSS but I have to implement a lot:

almost all the code in application.py: index(), buy(), sell(), history(), register(), quote();
allow users to change passwords in index();
write additional html templates with Jinja template language.
